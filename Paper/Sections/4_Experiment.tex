\subsection{XArm Visual Pick and Place}


While the UR5 robot is a high performance industrial robot, the XArm is an accessible low-cost 7 DOF manipulation, which we control at approximately 0.5 Hz. 
Similar to Section 3.2, the task requires localizing and grasping a soft object and moving it from one bin to another and back, shown in Figure 6. We connect the object to the gripper with a string, which makes it less likely for the object to get stuck in corners at the cost of more complex dynamics. The sparse reward, discrete action space, 
and observation space match the UR5 setup except for the addition of depth image observations.
