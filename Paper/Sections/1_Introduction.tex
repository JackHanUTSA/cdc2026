We use world model to predict the future based on historical data.\cite{hafner2019dream} world models allow for planning and behavior 
learning given only small amounts of real world interaction. In the past the robot research focussed on the dynamic of world or the dynamic of the robot 
itself. However, in this paper, we focus on the dynamic of the environment and dynamic of robot body framework. We emphasize the importance of 
understanding the environment's dynamics and the robot's body dynamics for effective planning and behavior learning. 
This approach can lead to more efficient and adaptive robots that can handle a wide range of tasks in various environments. as shown in Figure 1.
